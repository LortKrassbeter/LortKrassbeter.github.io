# Getting started


This post serves one purpose and one purpose only: getting started with a habit of writing.

Like many people, I once had a travel blog when I was studying abroad. Probably like many people I had hoped to carry over the routine of writing to my routine of life. For me this did not occur and instead my last post was about my last days abroad.

Now I realize that this makes perfect sense. Travelling or living abroad naturally comes with a stack of new experiences and rich opportunity for taking photos. It makes the habit of writing easy: Just think about the last event you remember and write about what you saw, realized or felt. On top of that you get to attach those cool looking photos that make everyone at home envy you. Easy as a pie.

When it comes to sustaining a writing habit in the busy world of daily life the incentives don't quite align. Hmm, it seems as if the capability of excitement is impeded by routine. Guess what: routine _is_ boring, in a sense, or rather viewed from a certain perspective. But this doesn't meant that there is nothing new and exciting happening. In fact, by virtue of being human we can not cease to notice patterns in the noise and make connections that nobody has made before.

But how to incorporate these random events of inspiration with a solid writing habit? When the moment strikes, we are unlikely to be ready to write and when sitting down to write away, an exiting event is improbable. Thus, must a habit of writing be futile? How to make sure we are not running short of wonder?

Well, although I can not guarantee any of my ideas to work, I can think of at least two complementary habits that could still enable us to achieve our goal:

First, we must record our inspiration. 
When writing down our travel experiences we easily recall all the outstanding experiences in our memory by association with recent locations of our body and states of our mind. But when it comes to the no less exciting incidents that quickly fade away in our regular environment on a regular day, it is not enough to notice the thing of interest, but it is of utmost importance to document such thing for later reference in our writing.

The second thing we can do to address a lack of inspiration is to _view ourselves from an alien perspective_. Just like a foreigner confronted with a new culture we must regularly question the status quo of what is going on in our lives. Why are things the way they are? What led up to the current situation? Is there anything new that we can learn from observing our 'boring' lives?

With these tips I, myself, hope to get started on the way to a writing habit that sticks around.
As my list of super exciting pieces of inspiration is growing I will share some of them on this site for everyone's amusement!

Happy new year 2021 and stay healthy everyone!
